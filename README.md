This folder contains exercises used in the course IN3015/4015 at UiO.



The original official files can be downloaded in the [USTB repository](https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/src/master/examples/UiO_course_IN4015_Ultrasound_Imaging/). This repo includes some solution codes (except the sonar module) which might contain errors implemented by me . The writing problems or reports were left for you to finish :) Please don't directly copy and paste the code to submit if you were participating in the course.
