This folder contains exercises used in the course IN3015/4015 at UiO.



This repo includes some self-implemented solution codes for US imaging-related modules (including the legacy CF module and excluding the sonar/doppler experiment module) .  The original official files can be downloaded in the [USTB repository](https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/src/master/examples/UiO_course_IN4015_Ultrasound_Imaging/). 

- Implementations might be wrong or inefficient and pull requests are welcomed.

- The writing problems or reports were left for readers to finish :) 

- !!! Please don't directly copy and paste the code to submit if you are participating in the course.
